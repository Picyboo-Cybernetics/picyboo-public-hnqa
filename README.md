# HNQA: Hybrid Neural Quantum Architecture

**Series:** Picyboo Public Research Series  
**Organization:** Picyboo Cybernetics Inc., Research Lab (Canada)

## Overview
Breakthrough: AI Systems That Process Ambiguity Like Human Cognition

HNQA encodes quantum superposition principles into classical neural architectures, enabling AI systems to maintain multiple competing hypotheses and resolve them contextually. It treats uncertainty as signal rather than noise, addressing brittleness from premature collapse to single interpretations.

**Keywords:** Quantum Machine Learning, Probabilistic AI, Cognitive Architecture, Superposition Encoding, AGI Foundations, Uncertainty Modeling, Hybrid Systems
