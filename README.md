**Organization:** Picyboo Cybernetics Inc., Research Lab (Canada)

**Keywords:** Quantum Machine Learning, Probabilistic AI, Cognitive Architecture, Superposition Encoding, AGI Foundations, Uncertainty Modeling, Hybrid Systems

## Overview
HNQA encodes quantum superposition principles into classical neural architectures, enabling AI systems to maintain multiple competing hypotheses and resolve them contextually. It treats uncertainty as signal rather than noise, addressing brittleness caused by premature collapse to single interpretations.

This repository mirrors the concepts explored in the accompanying whitepaper and provides scaffolding for future reference implementations, experiments, and documentation that expand on the Hybrid Neural Quantum Architecture research program.

## Whitepaper
- PDF: docs/halenta-hybrid-neural-quantum-architecture-(hnqa)-2025-10-10-v1_3.pdf  
- DOI:  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17455262

## Repository purpose
Public research reference for industry collaborators and academic partners. Mirrors the technical whitepaper and provides stubs for reference implementations or models.

## Contents
- `models/` — Minimal, dependency-free Python reference implementations that mirror the reasoning patterns described in the whitepaper.
- `experiments/` — Documentation scaffold describing planned evaluation tracks for ambiguity retention, contextual collapse, and resource profiling.
- `docs/` — Published whitepaper (PDF) plus any future supporting materials.

## Status
Openly published for transparency. Implementation stubs included. Roadmaps and code will be added as they mature.
